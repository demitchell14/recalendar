# ReCalendar v0.2
The goal of this is to be a relatively simple Calendar written with ReactJS that can handle events.

Currently, I use [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/), however, for my purposes, its a little bit heavy, as I really only need
a few specific features. I'm sure there are others in the same boat I'm in, so I'm making this an
open-source project.

#
*This is currently in development, so it still has the entire* `create-react-app` *wrapper on it as well
the default npm commands.* `npm start`, `npm run build`, `npm run test` *Nothing fancy yet ;)* That being said,
if you wanted to use it outside of this project, you'll need to manually extract the `Calendar` folder from `./src`.
